# News-Category-Prediction

The project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance news article categorization, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems using the Microsoft News Dataset (MIND). The objective was to build and evaluate multiple models, including Bag of Words with TF-IDF, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, to categorize news articles accurately. Additionally, the project includes a sentiment analysis component to gauge the emotional tone of articles and a content-based recommendation system to personalize news suggestions. Despite the challenges of an imbalanced dataset, the models achieved around 73% accuracy, highlighting the potential for future improvements through balanced data and advanced algorithms. The project aims to refine news classification and recommendation systems, offering insights into optimizing performance and expanding the scope of news content analysis.
